PythonData
===========

Python Data provides modules for various implementations of data
stuctures as well as algorithms and tools for analyzing/manipulating
them. 

These modules are mainly focused around *new* students of computer
science and thusly contain name focused variables as well as longer
comments and explanations in order to describe some of the uses of 
each algorithm/data structure (i.e. explaining how quicksort works 
or what a priority queue is).
